# segmentation

Supplementary material for VISAPP paper "Noise-resistant Unsupervised Object Segmentation in Multi-view Indoor Point Clouds"

This project contains: 

1) Code to perform multi-scale evaluation of segmentation on 3D data. For this you need a labelled result along with two files for ground truth. 

2) Point cloud datasets with ground truth labelling on two levels.
